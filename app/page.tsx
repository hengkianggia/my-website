            I&#39;m a frontend developer. Currently, I&#39;m still studying in
            my final semester at Brawijaya University. I really like the
            technology environment and have been studying this field for about 3
            years. I really enjoyed itüéâ i&#39;ts very exciting.

            I create educational content for developers, teaching them about web
            development, JavaScript and TypeScript, React and Next.js, and more.
            This comes in all forms: blog posts, videos, tweets, conference
            talks, and workshops. You can watch some of my favorites below.
